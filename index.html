                    <h2>Carpentry</h2>
                    <p>I started working in high end residential construction as a sophomore in high school. Being home schooled really allowed me a tremendous amount of flexibility opening me up to a lot of opportunities. My junior year of high school I
                        was working full time through the summers and part time through the school year, doing school 2 days a week and working the other 3 days.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I have had the opportunity to be a part of the building community for 7 years now, working on all aspects of the project. Working through high school I was exposed to all aspects of the build, that is actually swinging a hammer. Then
                        at the end of high school and more recently I have been able to transition out of doing the work and have gained experience being able manage and lead the job sites. With a wide variety of experiences in this field I feel adequately
                        prepared to tackle and project that might arise.</p>

                <h1>Coaching</h1>
                <p>In junior high my dad built a gym in the basement of our house at the time, and I fell in love. Through high school I spent almost all of my free time down there in the basement or researching everything I could about anything to do with
                    fitness and nutrition. I still am in love with the gym and now I get to take what I have learned and have been able to accomplish and share that with others. I started coaching people several years ago and have been able to train people
                    helping some people lose 30-50lbs and help other hit big pr's.&nbsp;</p><button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button">visit download page</button></div>
